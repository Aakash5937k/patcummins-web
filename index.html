                    <p>Patrick James Cummins (born 8 May 1993) is an Australian international cricketer who captains the Australia men's national cricket team in Test and One Day International cricket.[6] Cummins is widely regarded as one of the finest fast bowlers that Australia has produced.[7][8][9] Cummins was a member of the Australian team that won the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, vice-captain of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup win, and was the winning captain of the 2021–23 ICC World Test Championship and the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup.
                    Cummins made his Test debut at the age of 18 in 2011. Injuries then forced him out of international cricket until 2015, and out of Test cricket until 2018. After the completion of the 2018–19 home cricket season in the Australian summer, Cummins was awarded with the Allan Border Medal in recognition of being the best performing Australian cricketer of the year and was also nominated ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year in 2019. He was appointed as Australia's Test captain on a permanent basis in November 2021.[10] In 2023, he was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy by the ICC.</p>
